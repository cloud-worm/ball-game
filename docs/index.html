<h3 id="the-game">The Game</h3>
<p>Ball Game is a physics-based game. You control a ball that you can shoot in any direction, with variable force; however, you may only shoot when the ball is touching something else, like a wall or the floor. You also have a limited amount of shots for each level, meaning that you must time each shot perfectly right.</p>
<p>Different materials will have different effects on the ball — while the regular, black walls does not bounce, pink walls will send your ball flying away. The game is all about aiming and timing your shots correctly to attain the final objective.</p>
<h3 id="development">Development</h3>
<p>The game was created using the <a href="https://unity.com/">Unity game engine</a> (version 22.2.6f1), and therefore the language C#. The source code is available at the <a href="https://github.com/cloud-worm/ball-game">official GitHub repository</a>, and is licensed under the GNU General Public License.</p>
<p>The game is fully free and has no ads or microtransactions or whatnot. The source code is also written in a way that’s easy to understand for beginners, and is elegantly commented for easier reading.</p>
<h3 id="download--install">Download &amp; Install</h3>
<p>There are two ways to get the game:</p>
<ul>
<li>You can get the latest Android <code>.apk</code> build from the <a href="https://github.com/cloud-worm/ball-game/releases">GitHub releases page</a>.</li>
<li>Alternatively, you can build the source by downloading it from said release page, or get the current development commit by running:</li>
</ul>
<pre class=" language-bash"><code class="prism  language-bash">$ <span class="token function">git</span> clone <span class="token string">"https://github.com/cloud-worm/ball-game"</span>
</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>Building from source allows building towards iOS, desktop, etc. Note that you will need to have Unity installed.</li>
<li>Hopefully I’ll get it published on Google Play soon. iOS will probably have to wait a little longer though 😊</li>
</ul>
